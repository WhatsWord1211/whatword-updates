- iOS ad fixes
- OTA updates possible via runtimeVersion 1.2.3

### 1.2.4 (Build 40)

## Important Notes

### Runtime Version Updated
- Changed from `1.2.3` → `1.2.5`
- This means:
  - Users on 1.2.3 will need to update to 1.2.5 from App Store
  - Future OTA updates will target runtimeVersion 1.2.5
  - The friend fixes from the OTA are now "baked in" to the binary

### What This Means for Users
1. **Existing users on 1.2.3:** Will get prompted to update to 1.2.5 from App Store
2. **New users:** Will get 1.2.5 with all fixes included
3. **Friend functionality:** Works perfectly (already fixed in previous OTA, now permanent)
4. **iPad users:** Will have much better experience with new responsive UI
5. **iOS users:** ATT prompt will appear correctly on first launch

---

## Testing Confirmation

To verify the friend fix is working:
1. Search for a user by username
2. Send a friend request
3. Check that request appears in recipient's app
4. Accept/decline should work correctly
5. Friend list should update properly

The code shows all the proper NEW subcollection system implementation throughout.

## Files Changed (vs 1.2.4)

**For ATT Fix:**
- `src/consentManager.js` - Enhanced ATT flow
- `app.json` - Updated ATT description

**For iPad UI:**
- `src/responsive.js` - NEW FILE
- `src/styles.js` - Updated with responsive utilities

**Version Tracking:**
- `package.json` - Version 1.2.5
- `app.json` - Version 1.2.5, build 41, runtimeVersion 1.2.5
- `version.json` - Updated metadata

**Friend Functionality:**
- NO CHANGES NEEDED - Already has the OTA fixes in the codebase

---

## Summary

**Yes, this version DOES have the improved add friend functionality.**

The friend system fix was already in the codebase when we started working on the Apple rejection fixes. All we did was add the ATT and iPad UI improvements on top of the existing working friend system.

Build 1.2.5 is essentially:
```
1.2.3 (with friend OTA fixes) + ATT enhancement + iPad responsive UI = 1.2.5
```

Everything from the previous working version is preserved and enhanced.
