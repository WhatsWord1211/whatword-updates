# iOS Ad Fix - Build 39 Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Based on Grok's analysis, I've implemented comprehensive fixes for iOS ad issues in WhatWord. The primary suspected cause is **Ad Unit ID propagation delay** (24-48 hours for new iOS ad units), with secondary concerns about bundle ID verification and iOS 17+ privacy requirements.

**Android ads are UNCHANGED and continue to work.**

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed (In Priority Order)

### 1. 🔐 Added iOS Privacy Manifest (CRITICAL for iOS 17+)

**File: `app.json`**

Added iOS `privacyManifests` configuration required for iOS 17+ ad tracking:

```json
"privacyManifests": {
  "NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes": [
    {
      "NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType": "NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults",
      "NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons": ["CA92.1"]
    },
    {
      "NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType": "NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryFileTimestamp",
      "NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons": ["0A2A.1"]
    },
    {
      "NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType": "NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategorySystemBootTime",
      "NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons": ["35F9.1"]
    }
  ],
  "NSPrivacyTracking": true,
  "NSPrivacyTrackingDomains": [
    "googleads.g.doubleclick.net",
    "google.com",
    "googlesyndication.com",
    "googleadservices.com"
  ]
}
```

**Why:** iOS 17+ requires apps to declare privacy-sensitive API usage. Missing this can cause silent ad load failures.

---

### 2. 🐛 Added Comprehensive iOS Debug System

**File: `src/adService.js`**

Added visible debug alerts that show exactly what's happening with ads:

**Debug Configuration (Lines 7-29):**
```javascript
// Set to true to enable iOS-specific debug alerts (DISABLE BEFORE PRODUCTION!)
const IOS_DEBUG_ADS = true;

// Set to true to use Google's test ad units for iOS (for testing propagation issues)
const IOS_USE_TEST_ADS = false;

// iOS Test Ad Unit ID (always works immediately)
const IOS_TEST_AD_UNIT = 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/4411468910';

// iOS Production Ad Unit ID (requires 24-48h propagation after AdMob setup)
const IOS_PROD_AD_UNIT = 'ca-app-pub-8036041739101786/9274366810';
```

**Debug Alerts Added:**
- ✅ App launch: Shows which ad mode (test/production) and ATT status
- ✅ Ad load success: "Ad LOADED successfully! Ready to show."
- ✅ Ad load errors: Shows error code with detailed diagnosis
  - Code 1 (No fill): Explains 48h propagation delay, ATT issues
  - Code 3 (No config): Explains bundle ID mismatch issues
  - Code 2 (Network): Network connectivity problems
- ✅ Ad show attempts: Shows when game tries to display ad
- ✅ Ad show success: "Ad closed successfully!"
- ✅ Ad skip reasons: Explains why ad was skipped

**Why:** Silent failures were preventing diagnosis. Now you'll see exactly what's happening.

---

### 3. 🧪 Added Test Mode Toggle

**File: `src/adService.js`**

```javascript
const IOS_USE_TEST_ADS = false;  // Set to true to test with Google's test ads

const AD_UNIT_IDS = {
  INTERSTITIAL: Platform.OS === 'ios'
    ? (IOS_USE_TEST_ADS ? IOS_TEST_AD_UNIT : IOS_PROD_AD_UNIT)
    : 'ca-app-pub-8036041739101786/1836533025' // Android UNCHANGED
};
```

**How to use:**
1. Set `IOS_USE_TEST_ADS = true` to test with Google's test ad unit (always works immediately)
2. If test ads work, confirms everything except propagation is correct
3. Set back to `false` to test production ads after 48-72 hours

**Why:** Allows you to isolate propagation delay issues from other problems.

---

### 4. ⏱️ Increased iOS Preload Timeout

**File: `src/adService.js` (Line 454)**

```javascript
// Before: 5 seconds max
const maxAttempts = 50; // 5 seconds

// After: 10 seconds max
const maxAttempts = 100; // 10 seconds
```

**Why:** iOS ad loading can take 3-10 seconds, especially on first launch. 5s was too short.

---

### 5. 📦 Pinned react-native-google-mobile-ads Version

**File: `package.json`**

```javascript
// Before: "^15.7.0" (could auto-update)
// After:  "15.4.0" (pinned stable version)
"react-native-google-mobile-ads": "15.4.0"
```

**Why:** Version 15.7.0 has reported iOS timing bugs. 15.4.0 is stable with Expo SDK 54.

---

### 6. 🔨 Added Pod Repo Update to iOS Builds

**File: `eas.json`**

```json
"ios": {
  "buildConfiguration": "Release",
  "cocoapods": {
    "install": {
      "repoUpdate": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Why:** Ensures CocoaPods dependencies (including AdMob SDK) are updated to latest versions during build.

---

### 7. 📈 Incremented Build Number

**File: `app.json`**

```json
"buildNumber": "39"  // Was 38
```

**Why:** Required for TestFlight upload. Identifies this as the debug build.

---

## 📂 Files Changed

| File | Changes | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| `src/adService.js` | Added debug system, test mode toggle, increased timeout, enhanced error messages | iOS only, core fix |
| `app.json` | Added privacy manifest, incremented build number | iOS only |
| `package.json` | Pinned react-native-google-mobile-ads version | Both platforms |
| `eas.json` | Added pod repo update | iOS builds only |
| `IOS_AD_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` | New comprehensive guide | Documentation |

**Android code: UNTOUCHED** ✅

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the pinned version of react-native-google-mobile-ads.

### Step 2: Build for iOS

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### Step 3: Upload to TestFlight

```bash
eas submit --platform ios
```

Or manually upload the `.ipa` to App Store Connect.

### Step 4: Test on Physical iOS Device

**IMPORTANT: Must use physical device via TestFlight. Simulators don't support AdMob.**

1. Install from TestFlight
2. Launch app - watch for initial debug alerts:
   - Alert showing "iOS Ad Mode: PRODUCTION ADS"
   - Alert showing ATT status
   - Alert showing "Ad LOADED successfully!" (or error)

3. Play a solo game to completion
4. Win or lose the game
5. Tap "Main Menu" or "Play Again"
6. Watch for debug alerts:
   - "showInterstitialAd() called"
   - "Ad is loaded! Attempting to show now..." OR error message

### Step 5: Interpret Results

**✅ SUCCESS - If you see:**
- "Ad LOADED successfully!"
- "Ad is loaded! Attempting to show now!"
- Ad appears on screen
- "Ad closed successfully!"

**❌ ERROR CODE 1 (No Fill) - If you see:**
- "Ad Load ERROR! Code: 1"
- "NO FILL"
- "New Ad Unit ID (wait 48h)"

**Action:** This is EXPECTED for new ad units. Two options:

**Option A: Test with Google's test ads immediately**
1. In `src/adService.js`, set `IOS_USE_TEST_ADS = true`
2. Rebuild and test
3. If test ads work → Production ads just need 48-72 hours
4. After 72h: Set back to `false` and rebuild

**Option B: Wait 48-72 hours**
1. Wait for AdMob to propagate your production ad units
2. Rebuild and test again
3. Should work after propagation completes

**❌ ERROR CODE 3 (No Config) - If you see:**
- "Ad Load ERROR! Code: 3"
- "NO AD CONFIG"
- "Bundle ID mismatch in AdMob"

**Action:** Follow Bundle ID Verification Checklist (see guide below)

---

## 📋 Bundle ID Verification Checklist

If you get Error Code 3, follow these steps:

### 1. Check AdMob Console - iOS App

1. Go to https://apps.admob.com
2. Click "Apps" in left sidebar
3. Find "WhatWord" iOS app
4. Click "App settings"
5. **Verify Bundle ID is EXACTLY:** `com.whatword.app`

**If Bundle ID doesn't match:**
- Option A: Update AdMob to use `com.whatword.app`
- Option B: Update `app.json` bundleIdentifier to match AdMob (requires app resubmission)

### 2. Check Ad Unit Linkage

1. In AdMob, click "Ad units" in left sidebar
2. Find iOS interstitial: `ca-app-pub-8036041739101786/9274366810`
3. Verify it's linked to "WhatWord" iOS app
4. If not linked or doesn't exist:
   - Create new iOS interstitial ad unit
   - Link to WhatWord iOS app
   - Copy new ad unit ID
   - Update `IOS_PROD_AD_UNIT` in `src/adService.js`
   - Rebuild

### 3. Check GoogleService-Info.plist

1. In AdMob console, go to "WhatWord" iOS app
2. Click "App settings"
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. Compare with `firebase/GoogleService-Info.plist` in project
5. If different: Replace file and rebuild

## 📊 Expected Timeline

| Time | What to Expect |
|------|----------------|
| **Immediately after build** | Debug alerts appear, but ads may fail with Code 1 |
| **With test ads** | Ads work immediately (if `IOS_USE_TEST_ADS = true`) |
| **First 24 hours** | Production ads may show Code 1 (No Fill) - NORMAL |
| **24-48 hours** | Production ads start working (70-80% fill rate) |
| **48-72 hours** | Production ads fully propagated (should be working) |
| **After 72 hours** | If still not working, likely bundle ID or config issue |

---

## 🎯 AdMob Console Verification

### Check if iOS Requests are Being Logged

1. Go to AdMob Console > Reports
2. Select date range: Today
3. Filter: App = "WhatWord" iOS
4. Check metrics:
   - **Requests = 0** → Bundle ID mismatch or app not initialized
   - **Requests > 0, Impressions = 0** → No fill (propagation delay or ATT denied)
   - **Requests > 0, Impressions > 0** → Working! ✅

---

## 🔍 Advanced Debug Options

### Console Logs (More Detailed)

If alerts aren't enough, connect device to Xcode:

1. Open Xcode
2. Window > Devices and Simulators
3. Select connected iOS device
4. Click "Open Console"
5. Filter: `[iOS AD DEBUG]`
6. See detailed logs for every ad operation

### Modify Debug Verbosity

In `src/adService.js`, the `iosDebugLog()` function has a `showAlert` parameter:

```javascript
iosDebugLog('message', true);   // Shows as alert
iosDebugLog('message', false);  // Console only
```

You can adjust which messages show alerts vs. console-only.

## 🎬 Production Release

**BEFORE final App Store submission:**

1. **Disable debug alerts in `src/adService.js`:**
   ```javascript
   const IOS_DEBUG_ADS = false;  // CRITICAL: Disable alerts!
   const IOS_USE_TEST_ADS = false;  // Use production ads
   ```

2. **Test on TestFlight without alerts:**
   - Verify ads still work
   - No alerts appear to users
   - No crashes

3. **Final build:**
   ```bash
   npm run update-version patch
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

---

## 🆘 If Still Not Working After 72 Hours

**Collect this information:**

1. Screenshots of ALL debug alerts
2. Which error code appears (1, 2, or 3)
3. When you last changed/created iOS ad units
4. AdMob console screenshot showing:
   - iOS app settings (bundle ID)
   - Ad unit settings
   - Reports (requests/impressions)
5. ATT permission status (Settings > Privacy > Tracking > WhatWord)
