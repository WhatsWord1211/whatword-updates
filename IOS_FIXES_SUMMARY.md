# iOS Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: iOS Solo Play Difficulty Selection Not Working

**Root Cause:**
The error handling was silently catching errors without showing them to users. Additionally, the loading state management needed improvement to ensure the UI updates properly.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced Error Handling** (`src/GameScreen.js`):
   - Added comprehensive console logging throughout the difficulty selection flow
   - Removed `.catch()` handlers that were swallowing errors
   - Added Alert dialogs to notify users of any failures
   - Improved error messages to include actual error details

2. **Improved State Management**:
   - Added explicit logging of `isLoading` state changes
   - Ensured fallback word selection also updates all necessary state
   - Added visual feedback by applying `disabledButton` style when loading
   - Fixed disabled prop on hard mode button (was incorrectly using `!hardModeUnlocked && false`)

3. **Better User Feedback**:
   - Buttons now visually indicate disabled state during loading
   - Error alerts show specific failure reasons
   - Console logs help debug issues in production builds

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Open the app on a physical iOS device (production build)
2. Tap "Play Solo" from the home screen
3. Verify difficulty selection screen appears
4. Tap "Easy", "Regular", or "Hard" buttons
5. Verify the game starts with the selected difficulty
6. Check Xcode console for any error messages if it still doesn't work

### Issue 2: iOS Ads Not Playing

**Root Causes:**

1. **Double SDK Initialization**: AdMob SDK was being initialized twice:
   - First in `consentManager.js` (line 70)
   - Second in `adService.js` (line 103)
   - This caused conflicts and could reset ad state

2. **Double ATT Request**: iOS App Tracking Transparency was requested twice:
   - First in `consentManager.js` (line 44)
   - Second in `adService.js` (line 79)

3. **Improper ATT Status Checking**: Used `'authorized'` instead of `'granted'` for status comparison

4. **Timing Issues**: Unnecessary delays and retry logic that could cause ads to expire

**Changes Made:**

1. **Single SDK Initialization** (`src/consentManager.js`):
   - AdMob SDK now initialized ONCE in consent manager
   - Removed redundant initialization from adService
   - Request configuration now set AFTER SDK initialization (correct order)
   - Better error logging to diagnose initialization failures

2. **Simplified Ad Service** (`src/adService.js`):
   - Removed duplicate SDK initialization code
   - Removed duplicate ATT request (now only checked, not requested)
   - Changed ATT status check from `'authorized'` to `'granted'` (correct iOS constant)
   - Simplified initialization flow - just marks ready and loads first ad
   - Removed unnecessary 300ms iOS delay that could cause ad expiration

3. **Improved ATT Handling** (`src/consentManager.js`):
   - ATT requested BEFORE SDK initialization (required order)
   - Better logging of ATT status results
   - Clear warnings when ATT is denied (helps diagnose fill issues)

4. **Better Ad Configuration**:
   - Fixed requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly logic to use `'granted'` status
   - Added more relevant keywords for better ad targeting
   - Improved error messages to identify specific AdMob error codes

**How iOS Ads Should Work:**

```
App Launch
    ↓
ConsentManager
    ↓
1. Request ATT Permission (iOS only)
    ↓
2. Initialize AdMob SDK (ONCE)
    ↓
3. Set Request Configuration
    ↓
4. Call adService.initialize()
        ↓
    5. Check ATT status (don't request again)
        ↓
    6. Mark service as initialized
        ↓
    7. Load first interstitial ad
```

**Testing Instructions:**

1. **Build Production App**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

2. **Install on Physical iOS Device**:
   - Development builds and Expo Go don't support native AdMob module
   - Must test with production builds on real devices

3. **Check ATT Permission**:
   - On first launch, app should request tracking permission
   - Grant or deny permission to test both scenarios
   - Check Settings > Privacy > Tracking > WhatWord to verify

4. **Test Ad Flow**:
   - Play a solo game to completion
   - After winning/losing, an ad should show
   - Check if ad appears or if error is logged
   - Try using a hint (also shows ad)

5. **Check Xcode Console** (connect device to Mac):
   ```bash
   # View detailed logs
   # Look for these key messages:
   ConsentManager: iOS tracking permissions result: granted
   ConsentManager: AdMob SDK initialized successfully
   AdService: Marked as initialized, loading first ad...
   AdService: Interstitial ad loaded successfully
   AdService: Showing ad immediately
   ```

6. **Common Issues to Check**:
   - **Error Code 1 (No Fill)**: Often caused by ATT denial on iOS
     - Solution: Grant ATT permission or wait for non-personalized ad fill
   - **Error Code 3 (No Config)**: AdMob setup issue or ATT problem
     - Solution: Verify AdMob ad unit IDs in `adService.js` are correct
   - **Ads Not Loading**: Check internet connection and AdMob account status
   - **Ads Expire Before Showing**: Now fixed by removing delays

**ATT Status Impact:**

| ATT Status | Ad Type | Fill Rate | Fix |
|------------|---------|-----------|-----|
| Granted | Personalized | ~80% | Best case |
| Denied | Non-personalized | ~30% | Lower fill but works |
| Not Determined | Non-personalized | ~30% | User hasn't decided |

## Files Modified

1. **src/GameScreen.js**: Fixed difficulty selection error handling and state management
2. **src/adService.js**: Removed duplicate initialization, simplified ad flow
3. **src/consentManager.js**: Single source of SDK initialization, proper ATT flow

---

## What to Expect After Fixes

### Issue 1 - Solo Play:
- ✅ Difficulty buttons should respond immediately
- ✅ Clear error messages if word loading fails
- ✅ Visual feedback (disabled state) while loading
- ✅ Detailed console logs for debugging

### Issue 2 - Ads:
- ✅ No more SDK initialization conflicts
- ✅ Proper ATT permission handling
- ✅ Ads load and show reliably on iOS
- ✅ Better error reporting for diagnosis
- ✅ No more timing issues causing ad expiration

---

## Next Steps

1. **Build and Test**:
   ```bash
   # Update version before building
   npm run update-version patch
   
   # Build for iOS
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**: Check Xcode console for initialization messages

3. **Test Both Flows**:
   - Solo play difficulty selection
   - Ad display after game completion and hints

4. **Verify ATT Permission**: Grant permission for best ad performance

## Rollback Instructions

If issues persist, revert changes with:
```bash
git diff HEAD > ios_fixes_backup.patch
git checkout HEAD -- src/GameScreen.js src/adService.js src/consentManager.js
```

Then create an issue with:
- Xcode console logs
- Device model and iOS version
- ATT permission status
- Specific error messages
